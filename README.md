# Oh-My-Font-UnOriginal-Fonts-Magisk-Modules
Weird and Funky Fonts made with OMF

I'm new to the modding scene on android and tried looking around for fonts that I like but I really couldn't find any. So I ended up finding OMF and used it as a Template to build some font modules. I've tested some of them out and they seem to work but I haven't tried all of them. I will admit when I tried to use Google Play store it forced closed every time until I tried [ FontLoader by JingMatrix](https://github.com/JingMatrix/FontLoader) and it was smooth sailing from there. I'm uploading the fonts I've done so far so I hope y'all enjoy them.
