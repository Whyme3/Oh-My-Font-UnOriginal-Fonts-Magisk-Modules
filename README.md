# OhMyFont UnOriginal Fonts

I looked everywhere for fonts that I would like and couldn't find any so I ended up using Oh My Font as a template to make the font modules. I am calling  them UnOriginal Fonts because they are not your standard fonts that most use. I ened up making some unique fonts.

-Problems: I flashed a few of the modules and when I tried to use Google Play it would force shut everytime. But I found a solution for it. Just flash FontLoader by JingMatrix it will not only fix the problem but load the font in Google Apps. 

## Instructions

1: If you want Google Play to work flash FontLoader. [Download](https://github.com/Whyme3/Oh-My-Font-UnOriginal-Fonts-Magisk-Modules/raw/refs/heads/main/FontLoader/FontLoader.zip)

2: Flash the OMF UnOriginal Font Module.

3: Reboot

Your good to go now and it should work and load the font in pretty much every app.
